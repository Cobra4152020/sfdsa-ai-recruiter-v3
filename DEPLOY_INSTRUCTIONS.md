# Deployment Instructions

We've fixed the styling issue with the website by making the following changes:

1. Updated the Tailwind CSS CDN version in both:
   - `components/tailwind-cdn.tsx` (now using v3.4.17)
   - `app/layout.tsx` (now using v3.4.17)

2. Added proper CSS variables for Shadcn UI components to work correctly in both:
   - The layout.tsx file
   - The TailwindCDN component

3. Fixed the Supabase client singleton issue:
   - Updated import/export in lib/supabase-client.ts
   - Made sure client is properly exported for static builds

4. Updated vercel.json with:
   - Proper caching headers for CSS and static files
   - Environment variables to disable database checks during build

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to Vercel by pushing to your repository or using the Vercel CLI
2. After deployment, the site should have proper styling similar to your local development environment
3. If issues persist, check the Network tab in developer tools to ensure Tailwind CSS is being loaded correctly

## Troubleshooting

If the styling still has issues after deployment:

1. Check if the Tailwind CSS CDN link is being loaded (Network tab in browser dev tools)
2. Verify the deployment logs in Vercel console for any build errors
3. Try adding ?v=2 to your domain to bypass any cached resources

The most important change was updating the Tailwind version to match what's used in development (3.4.17 instead of 2.2.19) and ensuring CSS variables are properly set for the design system components.
