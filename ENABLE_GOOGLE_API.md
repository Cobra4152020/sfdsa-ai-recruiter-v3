## ✅ Current Status
Your API keys are **already configured correctly** in `.env.local`:
- OpenAI API Key: ✅ Working
- Google Search API Key: ✅ Configured 
- Google Search Engine ID: ✅ Configured

## 🔧 One Simple Step Required

The Custom Search API just needs to be **enabled** in your Google Cloud Console:

### **Click This Link:**
👉 **[Enable Custom Search API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/overview?project=1006333906200)**

1. Click the link above (it's specific to your project)
2. Click the **"Enable"** button
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for it to activate
4. Test Sgt. Ken with a current info question

## 🧪 Test After Enabling

After enabling the API, test with these commands:

```bash
# Test the API directly
node test-web-search.js

# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# Go to http://localhost:3000/chat-with-sgt-ken
# Ask: "What are the current SF Sheriff salary ranges?"
```

## 🎯 What This Will Enable

Once enabled, Sgt. Ken will be able to:
- ✅ Access real-time SF Sheriff information
- ✅ Get current salary and benefit data
- ✅ Provide updated SFERS retirement info
- ✅ Answer questions about SF city employee benefits
- ✅ Award bonus points (7 points vs 5 points)
- ✅ Show "current info used" indicators

## 🕐 Expected Timeline
- **API Activation**: 2-3 minutes after enabling
- **First Web Search**: Should work immediately
- **Full Functionality**: Available right away

## 🚨 If You Get Quota Errors Later
- **Free Tier**: 100 searches/day
- **Cost**: $5 per 1,000 additional searches
- **Typical Usage**: 10-50 searches/day for your platform

## ✅ Everything Else is Ready!
Your Sgt. Ken AI is fully configured and just waiting for this one API to be enabled!
