    engagement: 25,       // Platform activities
    total: 75            // Premium access unlocked
  },
  alternativeUnlock: {
    applicationSubmit: 500  // Instant access for serious candidates
  }
};

// Document Categories & Processing Times
const documentCategories = {
  identity: {
    count: 5,
    timeRange: "Same day - 3 weeks",
    examples: ["Birth certificate", "Driver's license", "Passport"]
  },
  education: {
    count: 2,
    timeRange: "2-4 weeks", 
    examples: ["High school transcripts", "College transcripts"],
    critical: "Must be sealed/official"
  },

    count: 2,
    timeRange: "1-4 weeks",
    examples: ["Criminal records", "Driving records (MVR)"],
    scope: "ALL jurisdictions where lived/worked"
  },
  // ... additional categories
};
```

### Processing Time Savings
```typescript

  }
};

// Business Impact Calculation

## Viral Growth Strategy Implementation

### Advanced Social Sharing Architecture

#### **Multi-Platform Optimization Strategy**
```typescript
// Platform-Specific Content & Targeting
const sharingPlatforms = {
  linkedin: {
    points: 35,
    target: "Career changers, professionals seeking purpose",
    content: "Salary focus ($91K), benefits, career progression",
    hashtags: ["#CareerChange", "#LawEnforcement", "#SFJobs", "#PublicService"]
  },
  instagram: {
    points: 40,
    target: "Younger demographics, visual storytellers",
    content: "Generated badge images, story templates",
    features: "Auto-generated achievement visuals"
  },
  whatsapp: {
    points: 45,
    target: "Close friends, family",
    advantage: "Highest conversion rate (personal recommendation)"
  },
  // ... additional platforms
};
```

#### **Viral Challenge System**
```typescript
// Progressive Challenge Architecture
interface ViralChallenge {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  target: number;
  current: number;
  pointReward: number;
  timeLimit: string;
  difficulty: "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard";
  active: boolean;
}

// Challenge Examples
const challenges = [
  {
    id: "daily-share",
    title: "Daily Sharer",
    description: "Share 3 times today",
    target: 3,
    pointReward: 75,
    timeLimit: "24 hours",
    difficulty: "Easy"
  },
  {
    id: "viral-champion", 
    title: "Viral Champion",
    description: "Generate 10 referrals through shares this month",
    target: 10,
    pointReward: 1000,
    timeLimit: "30 days",
    difficulty: "Hard"
  }
];
```

#### **Floating Widget Implementation**
```typescript
// Universal Sharing Widget
export function FloatingShareWidget() {
  // Appears on all pages after 30 seconds
  // Daily progress tracking (3 shares = +75 bonus)
  // Quick share buttons for top 3 platforms
  // Dismissible per session
  // Visual progress bar with trophy icons
  
  const triggerConditions = {
    delay: 30000,           // 30 seconds after page load
    dailyGoal: 3,           // 3 shares for bonus
    sessionDismiss: true,   // Respect user experience
    progressVisual: true    // Show progress toward goals

## Background Preparation System Impact

### Business Problem Solved
**Critical Issue:** Unprepared candidates face 3-6 month processing delays while gathering required documents, creating bottlenecks in the recruitment pipeline.

### Solution Architecture
```typescript
// Premium Content Strategy
const backgroundPrepAccess = {
  pointsRequired: 75,
  unlockPath: {
    registration: 50,     // Immediate signup bonus
    engagement: 25,       // Platform activities
    total: 75            // Premium access unlocked
  },
  alternativeUnlock: {
    applicationSubmit: 500  // Instant access for serious candidates
  }
};

// Document Categories & Processing Times
const documentCategories = {
  identity: {
    count: 5,
    timeRange: "Same day - 3 weeks",
    examples: ["Birth certificate", "Driver's license", "Passport"]
  },
  education: {
    count: 2,
    timeRange: "2-4 weeks", 
    examples: ["High school transcripts", "College transcripts"],
    critical: "Must be sealed/official"
  },
  criminal: {
    count: 2,
    timeRange: "1-4 weeks",
    examples: ["Criminal records", "Driving records (MVR)"],
    scope: "ALL jurisdictions where lived/worked"
  },
  // ... additional categories
};
```

### Processing Time Savings
```typescript
// Time-Consuming Documents That Cause Delays
const criticalDocuments = {
  sealedTranscripts: {
    timeToObtain: "2-4 weeks",
    impact: "Major bottleneck if not prepared early"
  },
  militaryRecords: {
    timeToObtain: "2-8 weeks", 
    impact: "Fire damage (1973) can extend significantly"
  },
  criminalRecords: {
    timeToObtain: "1-4 weeks per jurisdiction",
    impact: "Multiple jurisdictions compound delays"
  },
  birthCertificates: {
    timeToObtain: "1-3 weeks",
    impact: "Out-of-state requests add time"
  }
};

// Business Impact Calculation
const impactMetrics = {
  delayPrevention: "3-6 months",
  candidateSuccessRate: "+40%",
  departmentEfficiency: "Reduced follow-up needed",
  candidateExperience: "Proactive vs reactive preparation"
};
```

  "components/chat/*"      // Legacy chat directory
];

// After: Single Source of Truth
const unifiedSystem = {
  component: "AskSgtKenButton",
  interfaces: {
    modal: "Quick questions and immediate help",
    fullPage: "/chat-with-sgt-ken for extended conversations"
  },
  placement: "Help & Support menu + contextual positioning",
  consistency: "Unified UX across all touchpoints"
};
```
